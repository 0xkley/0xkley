## `👤 Me`
Backend developer with experience building APIs and server-side applications, mainly using Java and Spring Boot.

Currently focusing on offensive security and penetration testing, especially on web applications and APIs. I use my development background to better understand how vulnerabilities are introduced at code and architecture level.

## `🔬 Current focus`

- 🧪 Pentesting
- 🛡️ Application security (OWASP Top 10)
- 🔐 Secure backend development

## `🧠 Mindset`
Understanding how software is built is key to understanding how it breaks.

Always learning, testing, and improving, from both the developer and attacker perspective.

## `🛠️ Development`
